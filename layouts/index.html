        <h1 class="f2 f1-ns fw3 heading comp-blue">Who's this guy?</h1>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">Well, in short this guy is a <strong>web developer</strong> and <strong>designer</strong> from Sweden who is currently looking for a new gig!</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">I profile myself as a <strong>fullstack developer</strong> with focus on frontend, and with a keen interest in UI and UX design. 🙂 This goes hand in hand with my <strong>Bachelor's degree in Software enginnering</strong> and <strong>Master's degree in Interaction Design and Technologies</strong> from <a href="http://chalmers.se">Chalmers University of Technology</a>.</p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">I am a hardcore perfectionist at heart, although I've come to truly understand the benefits of iterating fast. ☝️ In some cases, done might really be better than perfect (this site is a good example of that 😅).</p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">Although, more than anything I value <strong>team spirit</strong> and having <strong>fun at work</strong> 😃 Merely putting in the hours and then going back to "real life" is not for me. With the right people, 12+ hours/day is a breeze.</p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">I use and have used a bunch of languages and techniques to date. Generally, if a problem needs a certain stack I'll learn it quickly (if I don't know it already) 🙃 I try to stay humble and true to myself though – JavaScript is really where I belong.</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">Either way, here's a few of the techniques I use:</p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">Ah I see what you're asking! 😄 Here's a short summary of me;</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">I see myself as a <strong>football</strong> (soccer) player through and through, even though injuries have kept me from the sport the last 10 years! I make up for it by playing <strong>Fifa</strong> on my <strong>PS4</strong> instead 😉</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">I enjoy the company of <strong>close friends and family</strong>. Usually at some local bar, at home playing video games, or at the gym working out.</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">If there's something missing in my life, it's <strong>travels</strong>. I stayed abroad in Istanbul during my Thesis work, and it really sparked my interest 🔥 I hope to stay outside of Sweden again sometime soon! 🛩</p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">Recently at <strong>Interaction Design and Technologies</strong> masters at Chalmers I learned a bunch of design techniques and processes. Above all – with the risk of sounding pretentious – this thought me how to really <strong>cultivate and nourish creativity</strong>, both individually and within groups.</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">Today, I know my way around these design principles:</p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy">During my studies I worked at <a href="http://ctk.se">Chalmers Teknologkonsulter AB</a> on various Web projects, by myself and in groups. I was also the <strong>first employee</strong> and <strong>lead developer</strong> at the <strong>startup <a href="http://vnudashboard.com">Vnu</a></strong> before the company had to shut its doors in the summer of '17. At Vnu I was responsible for the development of the company's web application (frontend, backend, db, deployment, etc.), written in Meteor.js.</p>
